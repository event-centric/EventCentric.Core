# EventCentric

Very early experimental volatile work in progress pre-alpha developer preview. There's little to no documentation. Things will break regularly and it will make you very angry and there will be tears. 

Impatient? [Buttercup.Protects](http://buttercup-php.github.io/protects/) is a well-documented earlier experiment, that you can use to learn about some of the underlying principles.
